      <h2 className="mt-0 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">Why retirement planning starts now</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        Retirement can last 20–30 years. The earlier you start saving, the more{" "}

          compound growth

        works in your favour. Waiting 10 years to start can cost you more than doubling your monthly contribution ever
        could recover.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">How much do you need?</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        A common estimate: multiply your desired annual retirement income by 25. Want $50,000/year? Aim for $1.25
        million. This comes from the{" "}
        <Link to="/glossary#4-percent-rule" className="text-[#A3FFD6] hover:underline">
          4% rule
        </Link>{" "}
        — the guideline that withdrawing 4% of savings annually is often sustainable for about 30 years. Use the{" "}
        <Link to="/tools/retirement" className="text-[#A3FFD6] hover:underline">
          Retirement Calculator
        </Link>{" "}
        to project your specific number.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">The three buckets of retirement income</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        Most people's retirement income comes from three places: government pensions (Social Security, CPP), employer
        plans (401k, RRSP, pension), and personal savings (investments, savings accounts). Understanding all three lets
        you plan the gaps — not every retiree has all three.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">Inflation quietly shrinks your nest egg</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        <Link to="/glossary#inflation" className="text-[#A3FFD6] hover:underline">
          Inflation
        </Link>{" "}
        means $1 million in 25 years buys less than $1 million today. Your savings target should account for rising
        prices — especially in healthcare, which tends to inflate faster than the general rate. Build in a buffer.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">Mini‑calculation: retirement income estimate</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        If you want $60,000/year in retirement, multiplying by 25 suggests a target of $1.5 million. Use the{" "}
        <Link to="/tools/retirement" className="text-[#A3FFD6] hover:underline">
          Retirement Calculator
        </Link>{" "}
        to see how contributions, returns, and time affect your path to that number.
      </p>

      <h2 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold text-[#E0E0E0]">Start small, increase consistently</h2>
      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        Even saving 5% now and increasing by 1% each year puts you dramatically ahead of doing nothing. Small,
        consistent contributions plus time and{" "}
