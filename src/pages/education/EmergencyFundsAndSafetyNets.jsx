        financial safety net that keeps emergencies from turning into long‑term debt.

      <p className="text-[#889988]">
        Emergency funds are typically kept in safe, liquid accounts — such as high‑interest savings — where you can
        access them quickly without market risk. The goal is reliability, not maximum return.
