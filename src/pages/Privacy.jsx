            TopMoneyTools is built for peace of mind. Your inputs never leave your device. We don't store your data,
            track your activity, or ask you to create an account.

            Every calculator runs entirely in your browser. When you reload a page, the numbers you entered are gone —
            by design. We have no database of your financial information because we never receive one.

            The only third-party service present is Google AdSense (when ads are enabled), which operates under its own
            privacy policy. We use placeholder slots until ads are configured; they then load Google's standard ad
            units.
          </p>
          <p>
            Just simple instruments that help you make better decisions — privately.
