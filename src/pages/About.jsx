            TopMoneyTools is built for people who want to understand their finances without complexity or pressure. Our
            calculators and education center explain inflation, budgeting, loan terms, and credit scores in everyday
            language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything runs privately on your device — no accounts, no tracking, no data collection. Just calm, clear
            financial guidance you can trust. Whether you're planning a monthly budget or comparing loan options, we
            help you make decisions with clarity and comfort.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our tools are calibrated with standard formulas (compound interest, amortization, the 4% rule). They're
            planning instruments — not personalized financial advice. For major decisions, talk to a licensed
            advisor.
